const about = () => <h2>I'm a former elementary school teacher turned software engineer. 
  I went from trying to understand little brains and managing behavior to trying to understand code and controlling output. 
  I'll let you decide which you think is more challenging. 
  Hint, computers do exactly what you tell them to do. Changing careers was no accident. 
  I transitioned to programming upon discovering my passion for relying on data and tech for creating 
  efficiencies to drive results that help others reach defined goals, as well as facilitating the design of the goal. 
  In the classroom, I became obsessed with using data and tech to improve my teaching and, most importantly my students' learning. 
  This is when I first looked at software engineering as something that I could use to enrich the lives of others 
  and find professional fulfillment for myself.</h2>
